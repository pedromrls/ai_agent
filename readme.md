# LLM Code Assistant

This project demonstrates how to connect a Large Language Model (LLM) to Python functions using structured function declarations and a tool schema. It enables the LLM to suggest function calls, which are then executed by the Python application.

## Features

- Lists available files and directories using the `get_files_info` function.
- Provides a framework for safely extending LLM capabilities via function declarations.
- Securely restricts LLM-initiated function calls within the working directory.
